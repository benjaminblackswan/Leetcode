## schema

Truncate table Person
insert into Person (id, email) values ('1', 'a@b.com')

# question

Table: Person

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
```

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.

 

**Write a solution to report all the duplicate emails. Note that it's guaranteed that the email field is not NULL.**

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 

Person table:

```
+----+---------+
| id | email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
```

Output: 

```
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
```

Explanation: a@b.com is repeated two times.

## solution

```
select email from person
group by email
having count(1) > 1
```
