## My Solution attemp 2
```
with CTE as
(
select distinct salary,
dense_rank() over (order by salary desc) as rank
from employee
)

select max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
from CTE
where rank = 2
```

## AI Solution
```
SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM (
    SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM Employee
) t
WHERE rnk = 2;
```
