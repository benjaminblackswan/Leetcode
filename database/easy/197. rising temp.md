## Schema
```
drop table if exists Weather
Create table Weather (id int, recordDate date, temperature int)
Truncate table Weather
insert into Weather (id, recordDate, temperature) values ('1', '2015-01-01', '10')
insert into Weather (id, recordDate, temperature) values ('2', '2015-01-02', '25')
insert into Weather (id, recordDate, temperature) values ('3', '2015-01-03', '20')
insert into Weather (id, recordDate, temperature) values ('4', '2015-01-04', '30')
```

## Question

Table: Weather

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
```


id is the column with unique values for this table.
There are no different rows with the same recordDate.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.

 

**Write a solution to find all dates' `id` with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).**

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
```
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
```

Output: 
```
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
```
Explanation: 
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).



## Solution

```
with CTE as (
select id
, recordDate
, temperature
, lag(recordDate) over (order by recordDate) as prev_date
, lag(temperature) over (order by recordDate) as prev_temp
from weather
)

select id from CTE
where temperature > prev_temp
and DATEDIFF(day, prev_date, recordDate) = 1
```
