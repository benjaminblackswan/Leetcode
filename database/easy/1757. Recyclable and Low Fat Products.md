## Schema
```
Drop table if exists products
Create table Products
(product_id int
, low_fats VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL CHECK (low_fats IN('Y','N'))
, recyclable VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL CHECK (recyclable IN('Y','N')))
insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('0', 'Y', 'N')
insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('1', 'Y', 'Y')
insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('2', 'N', 'Y')
insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('3', 'Y', 'Y')
insert into Products (product_id, low_fats, recyclable) values ('4', 'N', 'N')
```

## Question
Table: Products

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
```

product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.

 

Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Products table:

```
+-------------+----------+------------+
| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
+-------------+----------+------------+
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |
+-------------+----------+------------+
```

Output: 

```
+-------------+
| product_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
```

Explanation: Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.




## My Solution

```
select product_id from products
where 1=1
and low_fats = 'Y'
and recyclable = 'Y'
```
